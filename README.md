# Teams Meeting Randomiser

Are you having trouble keeping in touch with your team/company due to everyone working remotely?
This repository aims to help that.

### Objective

This application generates random teams based off the emails/team size you provide, 
and creates Outlook/Microsoft Teams meetings automatically on a given day/time each week, so you can ensure your colleagues/employees
are staying connected.

It's perfect for a quick coffee catch-up, akin to what you would have had in an office environment.
All the people invited need to do is click join - no hassle of creating the random teams and the meetings each week.
